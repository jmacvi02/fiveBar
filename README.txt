Purpose: 

    A library which Mechancial Engineering students can use to design and implement 
controllers for a five bar robot. Because ME students have a wide variety of coding experieince,
having to fully develop their own software to study controls can be a challenging/discouraging 
task. This software library seeks to mitigage these struggles.

List of Features:

1. Kinematics (fiveBarKin.h) 
    a. Perform forward and inverse kinematics calculations for specified five bar robot 
       configureation.
